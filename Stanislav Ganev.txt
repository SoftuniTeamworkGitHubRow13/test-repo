I am 24 year old guy who comes from a small town, I like to be creative and helpful to bunch of people
 around the world. I also love spending my time in games since my first encounter with, a computer 
I was completely blown away from how immersive and live changing their virtual world can be for me.
 I am also interested in every aspect of our live as human beings and always curios, always discovering undiscovered,
 always stays positive, because only thing needed to be happy is your own mindset.
